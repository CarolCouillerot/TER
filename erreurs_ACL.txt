The SOT model inference.     (B1)      (B2)       (B3)          (B4)  is the number of words of topic t describing the common ideas (o = 0) or original ideas ( o = 1) of school of thought c. The superscript ¬(d , s) means that words in sentence s of paper d are not counted. Nd¬,(cd , s ) (d ,c) ) counts the number of sen-tences in paper d describing school of thought c with sentence s removed from consideration. In Eqs. (B1)–(B4), the symbol S means summation over the corresponding variable. For example, Nc , b , o , t ( c ,0, o , S ) = ? t =1,  ,T N c , b , o , t ( c ,0, o, t) (B5)   o and  are jointly sam-  Latent variables b , t  pled in Eqs. (B2)–(B4). Nd¬,(bd , s , n ) ( d ,b ) counts the number of background (b = 0) or school-of-thought (b = 1) words in document d without counting  the n-th  token  in  sentence  s. Nb¬,v( d , s , n) (1,v) is the number of times vocabulary item v occurs as background word in the litera- ture collection without counting the n-th token in sentence s of paper d. ¬( d , s , n) (d ,0,o) is the  Nd , b , o  number of words describing either common ideas (o = 0) or original ideas (o = 1) of some school of thought without considering the n-th token in sentence s of paper d. ¬( d , s , n) (c ,0,o , t) is the  Nc , b , o , t   number of words of topic t in the literature col-  lection describing either common ideas (o = 0) or original ideas (o = 1) of school of thought c   without counting the n-th token in sentence s of  paper d. N b¬,t(,dv , s , n) (0,t , v) is the number of school-of-thought words of topic t which is instantiated  by vocabulary item v in the literature collection without counting the n-th token in sentence s of paper d.  828
